# WEB-assignment-2
In my assignment, I worked on three tasks using HTML and CSS. I learned the role of CSS in web development and how it makes webpages look better. I practiced using CSS properties for colors, fonts, margins, padding, borders, and backgrounds. By combining HTML and CSS, I created structured and visually appealing webpages.
