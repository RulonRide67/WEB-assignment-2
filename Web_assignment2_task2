                Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian and American actor, businessman, former politician, and former professional bodybuilder, known for his roles in high-profile action films. He served as the 38th governor of California from 2003 to 2011.
                 Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at age 15 and won the Mr. Universe title aged 20, and subsequently the Mr.
                 Olympia title seven times. He is tied with Phil Heath for the joint-second number of all-time Mr.
                 Olympia wins, behind Ronnie Coleman and Lee Haney, who are joint-first with eight wins each. Nicknamed the "Austrian Oak" in his bodybuilding days, he is regarded as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time.
                He has written books and articles about bodybuilding, including the autobiographical Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder (1977) and The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding (1998).[6][7] The Arnold Sports Festival, the second-most prestigious bodybuilding event after the Mr.
                 Olympia competition, is named after him.[8] He appeared in the bodybuilding documentary Pumping Iron (1977), which set him on his way to a career in films.
